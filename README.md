My name is Nathanael and I’m an undergrad studying computer science at Brunel university in london. 

I have a passion for computers in general but more specifically, cyber security fascinates me. 

I have been studying both online, and physical security from about the age of 14 and have taken many steps to learn about offensive security. 
Some things I’ve done include penetration testing courses, Hack The Box challenges, and Defcon security talks.

I am constantly trying to develop my skills, knowledge and understanding in all fields, and the hope of this github account is to display some of my best work. 
Please feel free to look around, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions. 

Thanks so much.
